## Results 

### Analysis of Pyber Data 

![analysis/Pyber_summary.png](analysis/Pyber_summary.png)

Rural Pyber users on average should expect to pay more for rides. Cities by nature have higher populations, leading to a bigger driver pool and allowing Pyber users to get lower fares.

The more urban areas were by far the biggest generators of fares for Pyber.

## Summary 

### Recommendations 
I would advise Pyber to create some type of incentive program to try to get more drivers out to rural and suburban areas with unmet demand.
